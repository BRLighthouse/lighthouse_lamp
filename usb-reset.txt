http://askubuntu.com/questions/645/how-do-you-reset-a-usb-device-from-the-command-line

I haven't found myself in your specific circumstances before, so I'm not sure
if it'll do enough, but the simplest way I've found to reset a USB device is
this command: (No external apps necessary)

sudo sh -c "echo 0 > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-4.6/authorized"
sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-4.6/authorized"

That's the actual one I use to reset my Kinect since libfreenect seems to have
no API for putting it back to sleep. It's on my Gentoo box, but the kernel
should be new enough to use the same path structure for sysfs.

Yours obviously wouldn't be 1-4.6 but you can either pull that device path from
your kernel log (dmesg) or you can use something like lsusb to get the vendor
and product IDs and then use a quick command like this to list how the paths
relate to different vendor/product ID pairs:

for X in /sys/bus/usb/devices/*; do 
    echo "$X"
    cat "$X/idVendor" 2>/dev/null 
    cat "$X/idProduct" 2>/dev/null
    echo
done
