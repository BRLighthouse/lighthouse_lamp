Black Rock Lighthouse Service

A Burning Man 2016 Honerarium Project

This runs on a Beaglebone Black, connected to an Enttec USB ->
DMX module talking to a discontinued 'Space Cannon II' DMX controlled
spotlight.

This app, written in Python, drives the main lighthouses' lamp itself and
(will eventually be) deployed via ansible inside lighting.git

INSTALL:

    pip install --pre -r requirements.txt

RUN:

    exercise.py - simple script used to exercise the lamp.

    oscrecv.py - exposes an interface over OSC which allows for direct control via
TouchOSC on iOS and Android.
